# Python_API_Challenge
"What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" With this question in mind, I looked at city data from lat (-90,90) and lng (-180,180). By plotting the resulting data, I was able to clearly determine the relationship between weather variables and latitude. Not only does the max temperature increase as it approaches latitude 0, humidty and cloudiness also increase. Although there is not a strong association of the Northern Hemisphere's wind speed vs. latitude up to 0, the Southern Hemisphere has increasing wind speed the further from 0 it gets.

Next, using the geoViews Python library and Geoapify API, I was able to filter down my ideal city paramaters to search for hotels within 10,000 meters.
